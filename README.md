#Crypto Prices
This is a small webpage that fetches and displays buy and sell prices for
the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price data is obtained using
public APIs made available by [Coinbase](https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/) and
[Gemini](https://docs.gemini.com/rest-api/). For each currency, the lowest 
buy price and the highest sell price are both shown in 
<span style="color: #3D9970">olive</span>. The site is composed entirely of
static files, so you can view it locally by cloning this repo and opening
`index.html` in your favorite web browser. Alternatively, [click here]
(https://bfard.github.io/Crypto-Prices/) for a live demo.
